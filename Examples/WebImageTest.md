## Testing Web Images

---

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

### GitHub

This slide demonstrates a web image loaded directly from GitHub's servers.

* The image is downloaded automatically
* No local file needed
* Works with https:// URLs

---

![PowerShell Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_256.png)

### PowerShell

This slide shows the PowerShell logo loaded from the official repository.

The Deck module automatically detects web URLs and uses the appropriate image loader.

Note: Only raster formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP) are supported - SVG files won't load.

### That's All!

Web images make presentations more flexible and reduce repository size.
